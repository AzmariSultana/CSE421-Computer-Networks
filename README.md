# CSE421-Computer-Networks

An introduction to fundamental concepts in the design and implementation of computer communication networks, their protocols, and applications. Topics to be covered include: overview of network architectures, applications, network programming interfaces (e.g., sockets), transport, congestion, routing, and data link protocols, addressing, local area networks, wireless networks, and network security. Examples will be drawn primarily from the Internet (e.g., TCP, UDP, and IP) protocol suite.

# Course Objectives
The objective of this course are to
1. Introduce the concepts of network architectures, topologies, layering and protocols.
2. Describe key application layer concepts such as network services required by applications, clients and servers.
3. Explain transport layer concepts, relationship with the network and application layers, and services such as principles of reliable data transfer and congestion.
4. Teach network layer concepts, routing principles, algorithms, and addressing and Internet protocols.
5. Identify link layer services, link layer address and multi-access techniques.
6. Teach basic knowledge of the use of cryptography and network security.
7. Explain the operation of wireless LANs based on the IEEE802.11 standards, and mobility.
8. Using simulation tools to observe and analyze behaviors of networking protocols.
9. Design and create a small network for an organization.
